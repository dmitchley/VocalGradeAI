# Great job! Just a few suggestions to improve your sentences:

1. "I am speaking for English now."

- Instead of using "for," you can say "in" or "using" English. So it would be: "I am speaking in English now" or "I am speaking using English now."

2. "I am learning for English now."

- Instead of using "for," you can use "to" or "in" to indicate the purpose of your learning. So it would be: "I am learning English now" or "I am learning in English now."

## Keep up the good work!
