## Feedback:

1. Instead of saying "At the point when," you can simply say "When" to make the sentence more concise.
2. Instead of saying "the channel started growing like a snowball," you can use a more specific verb to describe the growth, such as "the channel rapidly grew" or "the channel experienced exponential growth."
3. The phrase "And as for the mentaliation" is unclear and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Please provide more information or clarify what you mean by "mentaliation."
4. Instead of saying "it's not simple with COVID videos," you can rephrase it to say "creating content related to COVID videos is challenging" or "COVID videos present unique difficulties."
